This repository contains the code used to generate the figures in my Dalyell report titled **Investigating the Spatial Distribution of Mononuclear Phagocyte Populations During *in situ* HIV Transmission**. For the purposes of **reproducibility** of the methods, you can find the code in the `FinalFigures.qmd` file.
