# Welcome :wave: !

This repository contains the code used to generate the figures in my Dalyell report titled **'Investigating the Spatial Distribution of Mononuclear Phagocyte Populations During *in situ* HIV Transmission'**. For the purposes of **reproducing** the methods, you can find the original code in the `FinalFigures.qmd` file, and the figures generated for the report in the `FinalFigures` folder.
